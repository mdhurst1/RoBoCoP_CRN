= RoBoCoP_CRN

This folder contains the source code for RoBoCoP_CRN. RoBoCoP is the ROck and BOttom COastal Profile model. It is a numerical model for the evolution of shore platforms and the accumulation of cosmogenic isotopes. 

The model can handle morpholodynamic evolution of the coast in several ways. The RockyCoastCRN object developed by http://www.pnas.org/content/113/47/13336.abstract[Hurst et al. (2016)] simply assumed that coastal morphology developed through the equillibrium retreat of a constant shore platform and cliff geometry. The RoBoCoP object is a morphodynamic model similar to those of Sunamura (1992), Anderson et al. (1999), Trenhaile (2000) and Walkden & Hall (2005). 
This code was used in experiments by http://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/5/67/2017/[Hurst et al. (2017)] exploring the sensitivity of 10Be concentrations in shore platforms to the morphological evolution of the coast. 

These morphodynamic models are coupled with a model for the accumulation of cosmogenic radionuclides (CRNs), such as 10Be, in a shore platform as developed by http://www.pnas.org/content/113/47/13336.abstract[Hurst et al. (2016)].

== Getting started

If you are not familiar with compiling and running C++ code (or even if you are), we recommend heading over to the https://mdhurst1.github.io/RoBoCoP_CRN_Documentation/[documentation webpage] for more detailed instructions.

You can clone the repository by https://github.com/mdhurst1/RoBoCoP_CRN/archive/master.zip[downloading as a zip] or using git from the command line:

[source, console]
----
git clone https://github.com/mdhurst1/RoBoCoP_CRN.git
----

A series of driver files control the model runs. These can be found in the `driver_file` subdirectory. For example, navigate to the `driver_file` directory and compile the RoBoCoP_CRN model configuration using `make`:

[source,console]
----
$ cd driver_files
driver_files$ make -f RoBoCoP_CRN_make.make
----

This example will evolve a shore platform from an initial slope of 1:10 for 10000 years, with constant sea level and a 2 m tidal range and keep track of the accumulation of 10Be on the shore platform.  Run the model with:

[source,console]
----
driver_files$ ./RoBoCoP_CRN.out
----

The model will run and output two files, `ShoreProfile.xz` and `CRNConcentrations.xn`. These contain time series of the shore profile evolving and the concentrations of 10Be across the evolving shore platform.

Model output is plotted using python scripts. These are included in the `plotting_functions` subdirectory. Try running the script `plot_RoBoCoP_CRN_output.py` to visualise the results.
