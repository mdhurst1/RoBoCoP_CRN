= RoBoCoP_CRN

This folder contains the source code for RoBoCoP_CRN. RoBoCoP is the ROck and BOttom COastal Prolfile model. It is a numerical model for the evolution of shore platforms similar to those of Sunamura (1992), Anderson et al. (1999), Trenhaile (2000) and Walkden & Hall (2005). This morphodynamic model is coupled with a model for the accumulation of cosmogenic radionuclides (CRNs), such as 10Be, in a shore platform. 

This code was used in experiments exploring the sensitivity of 10Be concentrations in shore platforms to the morphological evolution of the coast. We will add a link to the paper here once it has been published.

== Getting started

If you are not familiar with compiling and running C++ code (or even if you are), we recommend heading over to the https://mdhurst1.github.io/RoBoCoP_CRN_Documentation/[documentation webpage] for more detailed instructions.

You can clone the repository by https://github.com/mdhurst1/RoBoCoP_CRN/archive/master.zip[downloading as a zip] or using git from the command line:

[source, console]
----
git clone https://github.com/mdhurst1/RoBoCoP_CRN.git
----

A series of driver files control the model runs. These can be found in the `driver_file` subdirectory. For example, navigate to the `driver_file` directory and compile the RoBoCoP_CRN model configuration using `make`:

[source,console]
----
$ cd driver_files
driver_files$ make -f RoBoCoP_CRN_make.make
----

This example will evolve a shore platform from an initial slope of 1:10 for 10000 years, with constant sea level and a 2 m tidal range and keep track of the accumulation of 10Be on the shore platform.  Run the model with:

[source,console]
----
driver_files$ ./RoBoCoP_CRN.out
----

The model will run and output two files, `ShoreProfile.xz` and `CRNConcentrations.xn`. These contain time series of the shore profile evolving and the concentrations of 10Be across the evolving shore platform.

Model output is plotted using python scripts. These are included in the `plotting_functions` subdirectory. Try running the script `plot_RoBoCoP_CRN_output.py` to visualise the results.
