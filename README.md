= RoBoCoP_CRN
This folder contains the source code for RoBoCoP_CRN. RoBoCoP is the ROck and BOttom COastal Prolfile model. It is a numerical model for the evolution of shore platforms similar to those of Sunamura (1992), Anderson et al. (1999), Trenhaile (2000) and Walkden & Hall (2005). This morphodynamic model is coupled with a model for the accumulation of cosmogenic radionuclides (CRNs), such as 10Be, in a shore platform. 

This code was used in experiments exploring the sensitivity of 10Be concentrations in shore platforms to the morphological evolution of the coast. We will add a link to the paper here once it has been published.
